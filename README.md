### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josh. 

I'm a software engineer at [Curve](https://curve.com/en-gb/). My big driving factors are writing code I'm proud of, delivering value wherever possible and having a culture which enables people to perform at their best.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently following: Robert Martin's "Coding a Better World Together"
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: "Space Junk :rocket:"

"A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in"

The Zen of :snake: should be read by every developer.
